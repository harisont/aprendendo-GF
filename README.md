# Aprendendo GF
My GF playground, using moslty Portuguese in the hope to learn some of it too. 

# Contents
- some [notes](notes.md) about random GF things I tended or still tend to forget & confuse
- some things I did to learn GF while taking the Computational Syntax course @ GU, collaterally to the [course assigmenents](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020):
  - my GF ["Hello world"](Hello/)
  - following the basic GF tutorial, a [Food (and Drink) grammar](Food/)
- some other things I did _after_ passing the Computational Syntax course:
- a [tiny tiny application grammar](Music/) for the music domain. The point here was to learn how to make use of the RGL in semantic grammars
- some [well documented](android/gf_android.md) but frustrating [experiments](android/) using GF in Android apps via the Java bindings
- a [Portuguese Micro grammar](portuguese) implemented while TAing in the Computational Syntax course (__ongoing__)
